**Value Proposition**: 
- Discover indie/underground tracks through intelligent agent debates
- Get personalized explanations for recommendations  
- Interact via natural language in web interface
- Experience flexible response times optimized for quality

## 4. Technical Design

### 4.1 LLM Strategy
**Primary**: Gemini 2.5 Flash  
- **Cost**: Free tier (15 requests/minute, 1M requests/day)
- **Performance**: Optimized for speed and reasoning
- **Advantages**: Latest model, excellent free tier, good for agents

### 4.2 Data Architecture

#### 4.2.1 Music Data Sources
**Last.fm API (Primary)**:
- 15M+ tracks with rich metadata
- Genres, tags, similar artists
- Artist/album/track relationships
- User listening patterns

**Spotify Web API (Secondary)**:
- Audio features (danceability, energy, valence)
- 30-second previews
- Track availability verification
- Rate limit: 100 requests/hour (free)

#### 4.2.2 Embedding Strategy (Future Enhancement - Post-MVP)

**Note**: The following describes the target custom embedding strategy, which will be implemented post-MVP. For the initial MVP, agents will primarily rely on Last.fm's existing metadata, tags, and similarity functions.

Following Spotify's Text2Tracks research findings:

**Text Embeddings (Primary - Post-MVP)**:
```python
# Use sentence-transformers for Last.fm metadata
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

# Combine: genre + tags + similar_artists + mood_descriptors
track_text = f"{genre} {tags} {mood} {similar_artists}"
embeddings = model.encode(track_text)
```

**Audio Features (Enhancement - Post-MVP)**:
```python
# Spotify's pre-computed features
audio_features = {
    'danceability': 0.8,
    'energy': 0.7, 
    'valence': 0.6,
    'acousticness': 0.3,
    'instrumentalness': 0.1
}
```

## ADDENDUM: MVP Implementation Update (January 2025)

### **4-Agent MVP Architecture (AgentX Planning-Aligned)**

Based on [AgentX course requirements](https://llmagents-learning.org/sp25) emphasizing **"search and planning"** as core agentic behavior, we're implementing a **4-agent system** that demonstrates strategic planning. For the MVP, all agents will primarily leverage Last.fm for music data, similarity, and tags.

#### **MVP Agent Architecture**
1. **PlannerAgent**: Strategic coordinator and planning engine ⭐ *(AgentX Core Requirement)*
2. **GenreMoodAgent**: Genre/mood specialist advocate (Utilizing Last.fm data)
3. **DiscoveryAgent**: Similarity/discovery specialist advocate (Utilizing Last.fm similarity & data)  
4. **JudgeAgent**: Multi-criteria decision maker with explanations

#### **AgentX Planning Alignment**

Our PlannerAgent directly addresses the course's focus on **"advanced inference and post-training techniques for building LLM agents that can search and plan"**:

```python
class PlannerAgent:
    """
    Demonstrates agentic planning behavior required for AgentX competition:
    - Strategic task decomposition
    - Resource allocation and coordination
    - Success criteria definition
    - Adaptive execution monitoring

```

### **Data Validation Strategy**

Before building the full system, we'll validate our data sources:

**Last.fm Quality Test**:
```python
def validate_lastfm_quality():
    test_queries = [
        "indie rock underground",
        "ambient electronic experimental", 
        "post-rock instrumental"
    ]
    # Test: metadata richness, discovery potential, diversity
```

**Spotify Integration Test**:
```python
def validate_spotify_integration():
    # Test: preview availability, audio features, response times
```

### **Caching & Rate Limiting**

**Conservative API Usage** *(Updated for 4 agents)*:
- Gemini: 12 calls/minute (4 agents × 2-3 calls each)
- Last.fm: 3 calls/second with aggressive caching
- Spotify: 50 calls/hour with batch requests

**Simple File-Based Cache**:
```python
cache_ttl = {
    "track_metadata": 24 * 7,  # 1 week
    "artist_similar": 24 * 3,  # 3 days  
    "user_preferences": 24,    # 1 day
    "planning_strategies": 12   # 12 hours (for similar queries)
}
```

## 5.2 Data Source Validation Plan

### **Last.fm API Validation**
```python
# Test script for Last.fm quality assessment
def validate_lastfm_quality():
    test_queries = [
        "indie rock underground",
        "ambient electronic experimental", 
        "post-rock instrumental",
        "folk indie singer-songwriter"
    ]
    
    results = {}
    for query in test_queries:
        tracks = lastfm_client.search_tracks(query, limit=20)
        results[query] = {
            "total_results": len(tracks),

## 5.3 Rate Limiting & Caching Strategy

### **API Rate Limiting**
```python
from asyncio import Semaphore
from functools import wraps
import time

class RateLimitedAPI:
    def __init__(self, calls_per_minute: int):
        self.calls_per_minute = calls_per_minute
        self.call_times = []
        
    def rate_limit(self, func):
        @wraps(func)
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            now = time.time()
            # Remove calls older than 1 minute
            self.call_times = [t for t in self.call_times if now - t < 60]
            
            if len(self.call_times) >= self.calls_per_minute:
                sleep_time = 60 - (now - self.call_times[0])
                time.sleep(sleep_time)
                
            self.call_times.append(now)
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
```

### **Simple Caching**
```python
import json
import hashlib
from pathlib import Path

class SimpleCache:
    def __init__(self, cache_dir: str = "data/cache"):
        self.cache_dir = Path(cache_dir)
        self.cache_dir.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
        
    def get(self, key: str):
        cache_file = self.cache_dir / f"{self._hash_key(key)}.json"
        if cache_file.exists():
            return json.loads(cache_file.read_text())
        return None
        
    def set(self, key: str, value: any, ttl_hours: int = 24):
        cache_file = self.cache_dir / f"{self._hash_key(key)}.json"
        cache_data = {
            "value": value,
            "expires": time.time() + (ttl_hours * 3600)
        }
        cache_file.write_text(json.dumps(cache_data))
        
    def _hash_key(self, key: str) -> str:
        return hashlib.md5(key.encode()).hexdigest()
```

    "Era preference? (90s, 2000s, recent, no preference)",
    "Explicit content okay? (yes/no)",
    "Any artists you love? (for style reference)"
]

# Step 2: Profile Creation
user_profile = {
    "genres": ["indie rock", "electronic"],
    "mood": "chill",
    "era": "2000s",
