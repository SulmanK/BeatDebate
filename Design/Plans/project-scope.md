BeatDebate ‚Äî Project Scope (AgentX 2025)

‚∏ª

1 . Objective

Build a chat-first recommender that helps music lovers uncover under-the-radar tracks and indie artists. It uses (a) a conversational Preference-Elicitation Agent to learn a listener‚Äôs tastes and (b) a Multi-Agent Debate loop that pits several ‚Äúadvocate‚Äù agents‚Äîand a critic‚Äîagainst each other. A Judge Agent delivers the top-3 songs plus concise ‚Äúwhy‚Äù explanations within ‚â§ 6 seconds in Discord and on a Hugging Face Space demo.

3 . In-Scope Functionality
	1.	Conversational onboarding
	‚Ä¢	4‚Äì6 quick questions (genre, mood, era, tolerance for explicit lyrics, etc.).
	‚Ä¢	Produces a JSON taste profile shared with downstream agents.
	2.	Candidate retrieval
	‚Ä¢	Pull 40‚Äì60 tracks per request from Million Playlist Dataset + FMA + public Spotify API.
	‚Ä¢	Embed tracks (CLAP audio + sentence-transformer tag vectors) and filter by region availability & explicit-content setting.
	3.	Multi-Agent Debate core
	‚Ä¢	Advocate Agents (k ‚âà 4) each champion a different track.
	‚Ä¢	Critic Agent flags duplicates, popularity bias, policy risks.
	‚Ä¢	Judge Agent ranks, diversity-balances, and writes explanations.
	4.	Response packaging
	‚Ä¢	Discord bot and Hugging Face Space both return:

{
  "title": "...",
  "artist": "...",
  "preview_url": "...",
  "why": "Two-sentence rationale"
}


	5.	Feedback loop
	‚Ä¢	üëç / üëé buttons log to Supabase; next session re-weights advocate priors.
	6.	Safety & licensing guard-rails
	‚Ä¢	OpenAI Moderation or equivalent on all user prompts.
	‚Ä¢	Final Judge pings Spotify track endpoint; drops any unavailable or DMCA-flagged items.

4 . Explicitly Out-of-Scope (for AgentX demo)
	‚Ä¢	Continuous playlist-generation (>3 tracks).
	‚Ä¢	Mobile native app.
	‚Ä¢	Paid licensing of full-length audio‚Äîdemo serves 30-second previews only.
	‚Ä¢	Real-time collaborative listening rooms.

5 . Technical Constraints & Choices
	‚Ä¢	LLM: GPT-4o (primary), Mixtral-8√ó22B fallback.
	‚Ä¢	Agent framework: LangGraph on top of AutoGen.
	‚Ä¢	Vector store: ChromaDB with 768-d embeddings.
	‚Ä¢	Back-end: FastAPI + Redis latency cache.
	‚Ä¢	Infra: 1√ó A10 GPU (Lambda credits) + small CPU instance for Discord bot.
