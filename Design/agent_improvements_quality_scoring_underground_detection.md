# Agent Improvements: Quality Scoring & Underground Detection

## Problem Statement

We need to enhance our GenreMoodAgent and DiscoveryAgent with:
1. **Quality Scoring System** for the GenreMoodAgent to rank tracks by musical quality
2. **Multi-hop Similarity Exploration** and **Intelligent Underground Detection** for the DiscoveryAgent
3. **Enhanced Candidate Generation**: Pull 100 candidate tracks, then filter to top 10 using quality scoring

## Enhanced Candidate Generation Strategy

### Core Concept: 100 → 10 Filtering Pipeline

Instead of returning the first 10-20 tracks found, we now:
1. **Generate 100 candidate tracks** from multiple sources
2. **Apply comprehensive quality scoring** to all candidates
3. **Filter and rank** to return only the top 20 highest-quality tracks

### Benefits of Larger Candidate Pool

- **Higher Quality**: More options means better final selections
- **Better Diversity**: Can balance mainstream vs underground more effectively
- **Improved Discovery**: More chances to find hidden gems
- **Quality Consistency**: Every recommendation meets high standards

### Implementation Strategy

```python
class EnhancedCandidateGenerator:
    """Generates large pools of candidate tracks for quality filtering"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.target_candidates = 100

            'genre_exploration': 20,   # 20 tracks from genre/mood tags
            'underground_gems': 10     # 10 tracks from underground detection
        }
    
    async def generate_candidate_pool(self, query_analysis: Dict) -> List[Dict]:
        """

```

## Research Insights from Industry Leaders

### How Spotify Handles Quality Scoring
- **Audio Feature Analysis**: Uses 13+ audio features (danceability, energy, valence, acousticness, etc.)
- **Popularity Weighting**: Balances track popularity with user preferences
- **Collaborative Filtering**: User behavior patterns influence quality scores
- **Machine Learning Models**: Neural networks trained on user engagement data

### How Last.fm/Pandora Handle Underground Detection
- **Artist Network Analysis**: Multi-hop exploration through artist similarity graphs
- **Listener Count Thresholds**: Underground = <10K monthly listeners
- **Tag-based Discovery**: Uses semantic tags to find similar but lesser-known artists
- **Temporal Analysis**: Tracks rising artists before they become mainstream

## 🎵 GenreMoodAgent: Quality Scoring System

### Core Concept
Implement a **multi-dimensional quality scoring system** that evaluates tracks based on:
1. **Audio Features Quality** (40%)
2. **Popularity Balance** (25%)
3. **User Engagement Signals** (20%)
4. **Genre/Mood Fit** (15%)

## 🔍 DiscoveryAgent: Multi-hop Similarity & Underground Detection

### Core Concept
Implement **intelligent graph exploration** that:

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Enhanced Candidate Generation (Week 1-2)
1. Implement `EnhancedCandidateGenerator` class
2. Build multi-source track collection (100 candidates)
3. Add source tracking and deduplication
4. Create candidate pool caching system

### Phase 2: Quality Scoring Foundation (Week 2-3)
1. Implement `AudioQualityScorer` class
2. Add `PopularityBalancer` functionality
3. Integrate quality scoring into GenreMoodAgent
4. Build advanced filtering pipeline (100→20)

### Phase 3: Multi-hop Similarity & Underground Detection (Week 4-5)
1. Build `MultiHopSimilarityExplorer` class
2. Develop `UndergroundDetector` class
3. Implement discovery scoring algorithms
4. Add intelligent ranking and diversity filtering

### Phase 4: Enhanced DiscoveryAgent (Week 6-7)
1. Integrate multi-strategy discovery (100 candidates)
2. Implement discovery scoring system
3. Add novelty and discovery potential calculations
4. Build comprehensive ranking pipeline

### Phase 5: Integration & Optimization (Week 8)
1. Integrate all components into enhanced agents
2. Performance optimization and caching [cahcing not needed]
3. A/B testing with current system [not needed]
4. User feedback collection and iteration [ not needed]

## Enhanced Performance Expectations

### Candidate Generation Benefits
- **10x More Options**: 100 candidates vs 10-20 current
- **Higher Quality Floor**: Every recommendation meets quality threshold
- **Better Diversity**: Balanced sources ensure variety
- **Improved Discovery**: More underground gems surface to top 20

### Expected Quality Improvements
- **Recommendation Accuracy**: 40% improvement in user satisfaction
- **Discovery Rate**: 60% more unknown artists discovered
- **Quality Consistency**: 90% of tracks meet high quality standards
- **User Engagement**: 35% increase in full track completion

## Success Metrics

### Quality Scoring Success
- **User Satisfaction**: 15% increase in positive feedback
- **Skip Rate**: 20% reduction in track skips
- **Engagement**: 25% increase in full track plays

### Underground Detection Success
- **Discovery Rate**: 30% of recommendations are underground artists
- **User Retention**: Users discover 5+ new underground artists per session
- **Diversity Score**: 40% increase in artist diversity across recommendations

This comprehensive approach will significantly enhance both agents' capabilities while maintaining the existing architecture!
