    Direct Artist Deep Dive:

        "More from [Artist X]"

        "Give me more [Artist X] tracks"

        "I liked [Artist X], show me other songs by them"

        Your system seems to be moving towards handling this well with the context_override and by having the JudgeAgent potentially relax diversity for the target_entity. The "20 more tracks" is a quantity aspect. Your max_recommendations in MusicRecommenderState is the primary control here. For a demo, showing up to 10 should be sufficient to prove the point. If the user asks for 20, you can still provide your max_recommendations (e.g., 10) and say, "Here are 10 more tracks by [Artist X]!"

    Style Continuation:

        "More like that"

        "I liked those, find similar ones"

        This requires your SmartContextManager to remember key characteristics (genres, moods, seed artists if applicable) of the last set of recommendations.

    Simple Refinements (Choose 1-2 powerful examples):

        "More like [Artist X] but make it [mood/genre qualifier]" (e.g., "More like The Beatles but more psychedelic"). This is a strong demo of combining previous context with new constraints. Your "artist-style refinement" logic is heading in this direction.

        "Less of X, more of Y" (e.g., "Less electronic, more acoustic from what you just gave me").

    Context Reset:

        "Actually, never mind."

        "Let's try something completely different."

1. Simple History Tracking & Filtering (Most Feasible for PoC)

This is the most straightforward approach and likely sufficient for your AgentX demo.

    Where to Implement: Primarily in the EnhancedRecommendationService before the main agent workflow, or as an early step in the JudgeAgent after candidates are collected but before final ranking and selection.

    How it Works:

        Maintain Session Recommendation History: Your ConversationContextManager (or the chat_interface if it keeps a backend-compatible history) needs to store a list of track IDs (or unique artist_title strings) that have been recommended in the current session.

            In EnhancedRecommendationService when preparing RecommendationResponse, you would update this history.

        Pass History to Agents/Judge: When a follow-up like "More from Artist X" occurs, the EnhancedRecommendationService (or PlannerAgent) can fetch this list of recently recommended track IDs for "Artist X".

        Filtering Candidates:

            Advocate Agents (GenreMoodAgent, DiscoveryAgent): If they are generating candidates for "Artist X", they could be instructed (via the planner's strategy) to try and fetch tracks that are not in the recently shown list. This is harder for them to do perfectly without knowing all available tracks.

            JudgeAgent (More Reliable): This is usually the best place. After the JudgeAgent has collected all candidates from the advocates, and before it does its final ranking/selection for the "More from Artist X" intent:

                It receives the list of "recently shown tracks by Artist X" from the state (populated by EnhancedRecommendationService or PlannerAgent based on context).

                It filters out any candidate tracks whose ID (or artist_title) matches one in the "recently shown" list.

                It then proceeds to rank and select from the remaining novel candidates by that artist.

    MusicRecommenderState Addition:

          
    class MusicRecommenderState(BaseModel):
        # ... existing fields ...
        recently_shown_track_ids_for_target_artist: Optional[List[str]] = Field(default_factory=list, description="Track IDs by the target artist recently shown to the user in this session for a deep-dive.")
