# Phase 2: PlannerAgent & 4-Agent MVP System - Design Document

**Date**: January 2025  
**Author**: BeatDebate Team  
**Status**: Implementation Ready  
**Review Status**: Approved  

---

## 1. Problem Statement

**Objective**: Implement a 4-agent MVP system with sophisticated planning capabilities to demonstrate agentic behavior for the AgentX competition.

**Current State**: We have validated Last.fm data sources and a working API client. Now we need to build the core agent system that showcases strategic planning and coordination.

**Value Proposition**: 
- Demonstrate advanced agentic planning behavior (AgentX core requirement)
- Show sophisticated multi-agent coordination
- Provide transparent reasoning chains for all decisions
- Create a working MVP that can be extended in later phases

---

## 2. Goals & Non-Goals

### ✅ In Scope (Phase 2)
- **PlannerAgent**: Strategic query analysis and coordination planning
- **GenreMoodAgent**: Strategy-guided genre/mood search implementation (primarily using Last.fm data for MVP)
- **DiscoveryAgent**: Strategy-guided similarity/discovery search implementation (primarily using Last.fm similarity and data for MVP)
- **JudgeAgent**: Strategy-informed multi-criteria decision making
- **LangGraph Workflow**: Complete orchestration of 4-agent process
- **State Management**: Shared state across agents
- **Basic Testing**: Unit tests for each agent

### ❌ Out of Scope (Phase 2)
- Frontend implementation (Phase 3)
- Complex UI/UX features (Phase 3)  
- Advanced caching optimization (Phase 3)
- Performance monitoring (Phase 3)
- User authentication (Post-MVP)
- Full playlist generation (Post-MVP)

    # Planning phase
    planning_strategy: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None
    execution_plan: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None
    
    # Advocate phase  
    genre_mood_recommendations: List[Dict] = []

## 6. Risk Mitigation

### 6.1 Technical Risks
**Risk**: API rate limiting during agent coordination  
**Mitigation**: Implement request queuing and caching

**Risk**: LangGraph state management complexity  
**Mitigation**: Start with simple state, iterate incrementally

**Risk**: Agent reasoning quality inconsistency  
**Mitigation**: Comprehensive prompt engineering and testing

### 6.2 Timeline Risks
**Risk**: Agent coordination more complex than expected  
**Mitigation**: Implement incremental workflow (2-agent → 3-agent → 4-agent)

**Risk**: LLM response latency impacting demo  
**Mitigation**: Implement response caching and async optimization

---

## 7. Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Begin Phase 2.1 implementation with base agent infrastructure
2. **Week 2 End**: Complete 4-agent MVP system with basic testing
3. **Week 3 Start**: Move to Phase 3 frontend implementation
4. **Ongoing**: Document all design decisions for AgentX submission

This design positions us to showcase sophisticated agentic planning behavior while maintaining a clear implementation timeline for the AgentX competition deadline.

## 8. Future Considerations (Post-MVP)

- **ChromaDB Integration and Custom Embedding Implementation**: 
  - Integrate ChromaDB as a local vector store.
  - Transition `DiscoveryAgent` to use custom embeddings (e.g., based on `genre + tags + mood + similar_artists` as per main design document) with ChromaDB as the primary source for similarity searches.
- **Advanced Caching**: Implement more sophisticated caching beyond basic API client caching.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Integrate detailed performance monitoring tools.
- **Frontend Enhancements**: Develop complex UI/UX features.
- **Expanded Agent Capabilities**: Further refine agent reasoning, negotiation, and learning.
