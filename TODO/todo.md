Key Missing Pieces from the Phase 2 Plan:
Full implementation and testing of PlannerAgent (verifying its internal logic against the design).
ChromaDB integration for the DiscoveryAgent. [not in our scope]
Implementation of the JudgeAgent.


Subsequent end-to-end integration testing.

Skipped Tests: The integration tests in tests/services/test_recommendation_engine_integration.py have 3 skipped tests due to complexities with mocking. While the unit tests for the recommendation engine and agents are passing, these integration tests would ideally be resolved.


Process

How data is primarily retrieved for a user query (MVP):
User Query comes in.
PlannerAgent analyzes the query and creates a strategy.
GenreMoodAgent (Advocate):
Receives its part of the strategy.
Primarily queries the Last.fm API using genre tags, mood-related tags, artist information, etc., to find relevant tracks.
It does not have its own persistent store of all possible tracks it might recommend. It fetches live from Last.fm based on the strategy.
DiscoveryAgent (Advocate):
Receives its part of the strategy.
Primarily queries the Last.fm API for similar artists/tracks (e.g., using artist.getSimilar, track.getSimilar) or top tracks for seed artists.
It also does not store all possible tracks. It fetches live from Last.fm.


Prepare for HuggingFace Deployment (Phase 3):
This involves creating the FastAPI backend and a simple frontend. While designated for Phase 3, ensuring the RecommendationEngine service is easily callable (e.g., from a FastAPI endpoint) could be a preparatory step.
Given this, what would you like to focus on?
Option 1 & 2 from my previous message (fix DiscoveryAgent linters, fix skipped integration tests) are still relevant for shoring up the current Phase 2 work.
We could also start thinking about how the RecommendationEngine would be exposed as an API, as a lead-up to Phase 3.
