Key Missing Pieces from the Phase 2 Plan:
Full implementation and testing of PlannerAgent (verifying its internal logic against the design).
ChromaDB integration for the DiscoveryAgent. [not in our scope]
Implementation of the JudgeAgent.
Implementation of the LangGraph workflow orchestration in src/services/recommendation_engine.py.
Subsequent end-to-end integration testing.



Process

How data is primarily retrieved for a user query (MVP):
User Query comes in.
PlannerAgent analyzes the query and creates a strategy.
GenreMoodAgent (Advocate):
Receives its part of the strategy.
Primarily queries the Last.fm API using genre tags, mood-related tags, artist information, etc., to find relevant tracks.
It does not have its own persistent store of all possible tracks it might recommend. It fetches live from Last.fm based on the strategy.
DiscoveryAgent (Advocate):
Receives its part of the strategy.
Primarily queries the Last.fm API for similar artists/tracks (e.g., using artist.getSimilar, track.getSimilar) or top tracks for seed artists.
It also does not store all possible tracks. It fetches live from Last.fm.
